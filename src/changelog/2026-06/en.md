### Available Models Scanner

Wolffish now scans your Ollama models folder on startup and shows every downloaded model in a new "Available" tab on the model picker. Pick any model already on disk and start chatting instantly — no re-download needed. The scanner reads Ollama's manifest files directly, so it works even if Ollama isn't running yet.

### Models Folder Picker

A new card above the model tabs displays the folder being scanned, with a copy-to-clipboard button and a "Choose folder" option to point Wolffish at a custom Ollama models directory.

### Model Details

Available model cards now show family, parameter size, quantization level, and format when Ollama can provide that information.
